#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# portroach config file
#
# Format:
#   - Comments begin with '#' and extend to the end of the line
#   - Variables are case insensitive, and may use spaces or underscores as word
#     separators (i.e. ports dir == ports_dir)
#   - Variables are separated from their values by a single '=' or '+='
#   - Paths must have no trailing slash
#   - Use quotes if you need to retain leading/trailing whitespace
#   - You can reuse previously set variables, like: %(name) - these variables
#     must use underscores, not spaces.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Space saving variables (only used within this file)

prefix =	/var/
tmpdir =	/tmp

#-- User Privileges -----------------------------------------------------------

# If these are not empty, portroach will switch to this user/group as soon as
# is practical after starting (if it is running as root).

#user =		portroach

#-- Directories ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Where to put generated HTML
html data dir =	%(wwwdir)/portroach

# Where HTML templates are kept
templates dir =	/usr/local/share/portroach/templates/

#-- Limit Processing ----------------------------------------------------------

# The following three variables are comma-separated lists of items that
# portroach should process. If left empty, portroach will not limit itself, and
# will process the whole ports tree.
#
# For building the database these restrictions are mutually exclusive and
# processed from top to bottom. Wildcards and commas are also ignored.

# Items in the list may contain * and ? wildcard characters.

restrict port =			# "     "  "     ports

#-- Mailing Settings ----------------------------------------------------------

# These are only required if you plan to send out reminder mails. It is enabled
# by default because you will need to add some addresses to the database for
# anything to happen anyway. The sender address will have the local hostname
# attached if it is a bare username.

mail subject =	OpenBSD ports you maintain which are out of date

#-- Output Settings -----------------------------------------------------------

# Timezone options. This is just eye-candy for template generation, but setting
# it to anything other than 'GMT' will cause portroach to use the local time,
# rather than GMT.

local timezone =	GMT	# Use Greenwich Time

# Hide results for ports with no new distfile?

hide unchanged =	false	# Show ports with no updates.

#   standard - Check for robots.txt but only respect portroach-specific bans.

#
# You can disable any robots checks with robots_enable. But think twice
# before doing so: angry system admins are likely to block bots they don't
