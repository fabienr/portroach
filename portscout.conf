# portscout config file
#
# Format:
#   - Comments begin with '#' and extend to the end of the line
#   - Variables are case insensitive, and may use spaces or underscores as word
#     separators (i.e. ports dir == ports_dir)
#   - Variables are separated from their values by a single '='
#   - Paths must have no trailing slash
#   - Use quotes if you need to retain leading/trailing whitespace
#   - You can reuse previously set variables, like: %(name) - these variables
#     must use underscores, not spaces.

# Space saving variables (only used within this file)

prefix           = /usr/local
tmpdir           = /tmp
wwwdir           = %(prefix)/www/data

#-- Data Provider -------------------------------------------------------------

# The DataSrc module is what portscout uses to compile information
# into its internal database. In other words, it's the layer between
# the repository of software and portscout itself.

# Option One: FreeBSD ports (NetBSD and OpenBSD supported too)

datasrc          = Portscout::DataSrc::Ports
#datasrc opts     = type:NetBSD

# Option Two: XML file

#datasrc          = Portscout::DataSrc::XML
#datasrc opts     = file:%(prefix)/etc/portscout/software.xml

#-- User Privileges -----------------------------------------------------------

# If these are not empty, portscout will switch to this
# user/group as soon as is practical after starting (if it
# is running as root).

#user             = portscout
#group            = portscout

#-- Directories ---------------------------------------------------------------

ports dir        = /usr/ports          		# Ports root directory

html data dir    = %(wwwdir)/portscout 		# Where to put generated HTML

templates dir    = %(prefix)/etc/portscout/templates # Where HTML templates are kept

#-- Limit Processing ----------------------------------------------------------

# The following three variables are comma-separated lists of
# items that portscout should process. If left empty, portscout
# will not limit itself, and will process the whole ports tree.

# Items in the list may contain * and ? wildcard characters.

restrict maintainer =        				# Limit to these maintainers
restrict category   =        				# "     "  "     categories
restrict port       =        				# "     "  "     ports

# Note that if you set restrict_maintainer, the entire ports
# tree needs to be processed to ascertain which ports meet
# the restriction criterion. This can be avoided if portscout
# has access to an INDEX file. If you don't have an INDEX file,
# and aren't impatient, you can switch off the following.
# With no maintainer restriction in place, it has no effect.

indexfile enable    = true   				# Use INDEX if needed

#-- Mailing Settings ----------------------------------------------------------

# These are only required if you plan to send out reminder mails
# It is enabled by default because you will need to add some
# addresses to the database for anything to happen anyway.

# The sender address will have the local hostname attached if it
# is a bare username.

mail enable      = true

mail from        = portscout 				# Sender address
mail subject     = FreeBSD ports you maintain which are out of date
mail method      = sendmail  				# Can be 'sendmail' or 'smtp'
#mail host        = localhost				# SMTP server, if method is 'smtp'

#-- Output Settings -----------------------------------------------------------

# Timezone options. This is just eye-candy for template generation,
# but setting it to anything other than 'GMT' will cause portscout
# to use the local time, rather than GMT.

local timezone   = GMT       				# Use Greenwich Time

# Hide results for ports with no new distfile?

hide unchanged   = false     				# Show ports with no updates.

#-- Other Settings ------------------------------------------------------------

mastersite limit = 4         				# Give up after this many sites

oldfound enable  = true      				# Stop if curr. distfile found

precious data    = false     				# Don't write anything to database
num children     = 15        				# How many worker children to spawn
workqueue size   = 20        				# How many ports per child at a time

# This variable specifies what version comparison algorithm
# to use. Supported values are "internal" and "pkg_version";
# the latter uses 'pkg_version -t', which is pretty straight-
# forward, but makes no attempt at best-guessing backwards
# looking version numbers. The former is a bit more
# sophisticated.

version compare  = internal  				# Version algorithm to use

# It is possible for individual ports to give us information
# such as the "limit version" regex. The following variable
# enables this.

portconfig enable = true     				# Respect port config hints

# If you're using portscout with a something other than the
# FreeBSD ports tree, switch this off to disable rejection of
# non-FreeBSD distfiles (such as 1.3.2-win32.zip).

freebsdhacks enable = true

# HTTP/FTP options

http timeout     = 120       				# Timeout in seconds

ftp timeout      = 120       				# Timeout in seconds
ftp passive      = true      				# Try to use passive FTP
ftp retries      = 3         				# Give up after this many failures

# The following tell portscout how to deal with sites which have a robots.txt
# file. Possible values:
#   standard - Check for robots.txt but only respect portscout-specific bans.
#   strict   - Respect all bans, including '*' wildcards.
#
# You can disable any robots checks with robots_enable. But think twice
# before doing so: angry system admins are likely to block bots they don't
# like using other methods.
#
# Plenty of sites have blanket robot bans, intended to stop search engine
# crawlers from indexing pages, and thus 'strict' is likely to affect the
# number of results we can gather.

robots enable    = true      				# Check for robots.txt files
robots checking  = strict    				# Strict robots.txt checking

# Database connection details

db user          = portscout 				# Database username
db name          = portscout 				# Database name
db pass          =           				# Password

# These two are only used for db_connstr, below

db host          =           				# Host
db port          =           				# Port

db connstr       = DBI:Pg:dbname=%(db_name)
#db connstr       = DBI:Pg:dbname=%(db_name);host=%(db_host);port=%(db_port)
#db connstr       = DBI:SQLite:dbname=/var/db/portscout.db
