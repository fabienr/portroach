-- Changes in 0.8.1 -----------------------------------------------------------

- The restrict_* configuration options now accept wildcards (? and *).


-- Changes in 0.8 -------------------------------------------------------------

- SQLite is now supported as a database backend. However, portscout must be
  run in non-forking mode when using SQLite. This may or may not change in the
  future, but as a consequence, it is recommended that SQLite only be used for
  light workloads.

  To put portscout into non-forking mode, be sure to set

      num children = 0

  in portscout.conf.

- CVSup logs are no longer required; the 'rebuild' method employed by
  portscout has now been replaced with the new 'mtime' option; this is cleaner
  and simpler, and requires no external files beyond a working ports tree.

- Master site data are no longer cached, nor even written to disk. The
  cache_ms_data and ms_data_dir options are now deprecated. The directory used
  for the latter can safely be deleted.

- An INDEX file is no longer required to run portscout, unless a
  restrict_maintainer constraint is in force. In this case, use of INDEX can
  be switched off using indexfile_enable, but rebuilding will be as slow as
  a full build.

- It was previously suggested that 'build' could be used in place of 'rebuild'
  in case CVSup logs could not be provided to portscout. This is no longer the
  case. Be sure to always use 'rebuild' and not 'build', except for initial
  population of the database.

- Static portconfig entries (as provided in initdata.sql) are now deprecated.
  These must be set via the PORTSCOUT variable in ports. Static entries can
  still be used, but will be lost if the port moves.
